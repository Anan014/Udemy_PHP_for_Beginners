# PHP for Beginners: Build a Content Management System from Scratch

Welcome to the repository for my PHP and MySQL learning journey! This repository contains my code, notes, and project files as I progress through the [PHP for Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/course/php-for-beginners-/) course on Udemy, taught by Dave Hollingworth.

## About the Course

This course is designed to help beginners learn PHP, the world's most popular web development language, and understand how to build dynamic web applications from scratch. Throughout this course, I'll be developing a complete Content Management System (CMS) using PHP and MySQL, which includes a robust foundation in coding best practices, security, object-oriented programming (OOP), and practical use of Bootstrap for styling.

### Course Highlights

- **Building a CMS from Scratch**: Step-by-step guidance to create a fully functional CMS using PHP and MySQL.
- **Security Best Practices**: Secure coding techniques to protect against common web vulnerabilities.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Introduction to OOP in PHP, including classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation.
- **Database Integration**: Learn to store and manage data using MySQL and PHP.
- **Real-World Development Skills**: Emphasis on coding standards, reusable code, and effective use of documentation.
- **Frontend Styling with Bootstrap**: Incorporate Bootstrap to enhance the appearance and usability of the CMS.
